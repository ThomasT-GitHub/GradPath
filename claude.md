# GradPath Project Context — For Claude or Other AIs

## Overview
**GradPath** is a web-based academic planning tool designed for UCF students to better understand their degree progress, visualize prerequisites, and plan semesters interactively.

This prototype is based on Figma designs and early UX coursework deliverables for **CAP 4102 – Web and User Experience (UX)** at UCF.

The MVP here is a **static HTML/CSS prototype** representing the key interface flows:
- Dashboard with degree progress and alerts
- Drag-and-drop semester planner
- Course discovery and progress visualization

## Core Goals
- Simplify complex academic audits (e.g., MyKnightAudit) into an intuitive visual interface.
- Provide actionable insight into time-to-graduation and course dependencies.
- Enable experimentation (“What-If” planning) to reduce stress and decision fatigue.

## Future Enhancements
When moving beyond static HTML:
- Convert UI to **React.js** or **Next.js** for interactivity.
- Integrate **course catalog APIs** and student data (mocked via JSON).
- Add **drag-and-drop scheduling logic** using libraries like `interact.js`.
- Include persistent storage (localStorage or backend API).
- Implement **UCF-themed design system** for color, typography, and branding consistency.

## Source Context
This project draws from:
- `Proposal Document Assignment.pdf` — defines proposal structure and grading rubric.
- `Requirements – CAP4102.pdf` — outlines GradPath’s functional and non-functional requirements.
- `Fall-2025 CAP 4102 Syllabus.pdf` — provides course policies, AI use, and deliverable schedule.

## Ownership
Created by **Team GradPath** (UCF CAP 4102, Fall 2025).  
Primary concept & design leadership: Thomas Triviño.

## Next Action for AI Agent
- If extending to code: generate modular components for the dashboard and planner.
- If writing documentation: produce “Requirements Traceability Matrix” or “Design System.md”.
- Maintain alignment with UCF’s UX and accessibility standards.
